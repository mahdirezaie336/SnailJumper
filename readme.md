# Snail jumper
** Neuroevolution AI **  

This is the Snail Jumper game in which we did something to make it play by AI. In this game the player must
jump over snail and insects by pressing space. It may seem so easy at first. But it can be extremely hard.
So we made an artificial neural network which can play this game automatically.

This ANN has only one hidden layer which has about 40 perceptrons. Also, it doesn't get updated using backpropagation
method. It uses evolutionary methods to update the weights. So it takes many generations to play the game correctly.

Here is a screenshot of the gameplay environment:
